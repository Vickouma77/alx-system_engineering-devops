# Configuration Management
Configuration management is a process that involves tracking and controlling changes to a system or product. It ensures that changes are made in a controlled and systematic way and that the integrity of the system or product is maintained over time.

While configuration management was not originally developed in the IT industry, it has become widely used in the field of server configuration management. In this context, configuration management involves managing the configuration of servers and other IT infrastructure components to ensure that they operate effectively and efficiently. This includes tasks such as monitoring and controlling changes to the server's operating system, applications, and other software components, as well as managing hardware configurations, network settings, and other system parameters.

# How it works
Configuration management works by establishing a system for tracking and controlling changes to a system or product. This involves identifying the different components of the system, defining their attributes and relationships, and establishing processes for managing changes to these components.

The process of configuration management typically involves the following steps:

    Identification: This involves identifying the different components of the system and defining their attributes and relationships.

    Configuration control: This involves establishing processes for managing changes to the system. This includes defining change management policies and procedures, establishing a change management board, and implementing change management tools and systems.

    Status accounting: This involves tracking and documenting the current status of the system and its components. This includes maintaining records of configuration items, their versions, and their relationships.

    Verification and audit: This involves verifying that the system and its components are configured correctly and conducting audits to ensure that the configuration management processes are being followed.

The goal of configuration management is to ensure that changes to the system are made in a controlled and systematic way, and that the integrity of the system is maintained over time. This helps to reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies, improve the reliability and stability of the system, and facilitate the management of changes and updates to the system.

# Puppet
Puppet is an open-source configuration management tool that enables you to automate the deployment and management of IT infrastructure. Puppet allows you to define the desired state of your infrastructure as code, and then uses that code to automatically configure and maintain your infrastructure.

The basic architecture of Puppet involves the following components:

    Puppet Master: The Puppet Master is the central control server that manages and coordinates the configuration of your infrastructure.

    Puppet Agents: Puppet Agents are the nodes or servers that are managed by Puppet. Agents communicate with the Puppet Master to receive configuration updates and execute those configurations.

    Manifests: Manifests are the code written in the Puppet language that describes the desired state of your infrastructure. Manifests are used by Puppet to configure and maintain your infrastructure.

    Modules: Modules are the collections of code and resources that are used to manage specific components of your infrastructure. Modules contain the code necessary to define the desired state of a particular component, such as a web server or database.

    Resources: Resources are the building blocks of your infrastructure configurations. Resources can represent files, services, users, or any other component of your infrastructure that you want to manage.

Puppet uses a declarative language to define the desired state of your infrastructure. This means that you define the end state that you want your infrastructure to be in, and Puppet automatically configures and maintains your infrastructure to achieve that state. Puppet also provides a web-based interface for managing your infrastructure, which makes it easy to monitor and manage your configurations.

Puppet is a powerful tool that can simplify the management of your IT infrastructure, reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies, and improve the reliability and stability of your systems. However, it does require some initial setup and configuration, as well as a learning curve to become proficient in its use.
